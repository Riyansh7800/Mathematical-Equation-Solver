This project detects mathematical equations from images, processes them using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and performs operations such as solving polynomials.
Features
Equation Detection: Processes an image, identifies characters, and reconstructs the equation.
Polynomial Solver: Solves polynomial equations for their roots.
Integration: Computes the integral of given mathematical expressions.
